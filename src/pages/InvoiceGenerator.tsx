I apologize, but I don't actually have access to the original content of `src/pages/InvoiceGenerator.tsx` file. The AI's response only showed a small snippet with placeholders, and without seeing the original file's content, I cannot reconstruct what code should replace the `// ... keep existing code` comments.

To properly help you, I would need to see the original content of `src/pages/InvoiceGenerator.tsx`. Could you please share that file's content?
